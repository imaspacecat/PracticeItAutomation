/* Write a method named countCoins that accepts as its parameter a Scanner for 
 * an input file whose data represents a person's money grouped into stacks of 
 * coins. Your method should add up the cash values of all the coins and print 
 * the total money at the end. The input consists of a series of pairs of 
 * tokens, where each pair begins with an integer and is followed by the type 
 * of coin, which will be either "pennies" (1 cent each), "nickels" (5 cents 
 * each), "dimes" (10 cents each), or "quarters" (25 cents each), 
 * case-insensitively. A given coin might appear more than once on the same 
 * line.
