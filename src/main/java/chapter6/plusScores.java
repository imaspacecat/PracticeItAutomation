/* Write a static method named plusScores that accepts as a parameter a 
 * Scanner containing a series of lines that represent student records. Each 
 * student record takes up two lines of input. The first line has the 
 * student's name and the second line has a series of plus and minus 
 * characters. The number of plus/minus characters will vary, but you may 
 * assume that at least one such character appears and that no other 
 * characters appear on the second line of each pair. For each student you 
 * should produce a line of output with the student's name followed by a colon 
 * followed by the percent of plus characters.
