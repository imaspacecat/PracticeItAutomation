/* Write a method named coinFlip that accepts as its parameter a Scanner for 
 * an input file. Assume that the input file data represents results of sets 
 * of coin flips that are either heads (H) or tails (T) in either upper or 
 * lower case, separated by at least one space. Your method should consider 
 * each line to be a separate set of coin flips and should output to the 
 * console the number of heads and the percentage of heads in that line, 
 * rounded to the nearest tenth. If this percentage is more than 50%, you 
 * should print a "You win" message. You may assume that the Scanner contains 
 * at least 1 line of input, that each line contains at least one token, and 
 * that no tokens other than h, H, t, or T will be in the lines.
