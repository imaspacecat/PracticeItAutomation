/* Write a method named mostCommonNames that accepts as its parameter a 
 * Scanner for an input file whose data is a sequence of lines, where each 
 * line contains a set of first names separated by spaces. Your method should 
 * print the name that occurs the most frequently in each line of the file. 
 * The method should also return the total number of unique names that were 
 * seen in the file. You may assume that no name appears on more than one line 
 * of the file. Each line should be considered separately from the others. On 
 * a given line, some names are repeated; all occurrences of a given name will 
 * appear consecutively in the file. If two or more names occur the same number
 * of times, print the one that appears earlier in the file. If every single 
 * name on a given line is different, every name will have 1 occurrence, so 
 * you should just print the first name in the file. You may assume that there 
 * is at least one line of data in the file and that each line will contain at 
 * least one name.
